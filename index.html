                 <p1><strong>Dr. Simon Tam: We'll get off the ship. River and I will get off at Haven. It'll be for the best. Kaylee Frye: Nobody's sayin' that. Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: Nobody but Jayne is sayin' that. [chased by a Reaver aircraft] Jayne Cobb: How come they ain't blowin' us out the air? Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: They wanna run us down. The up-close kill. River Tam: They want us alive when they eat us. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Half of writing history is hiding the truth. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [on the ship's intercom] This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then - explode. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: They take you down, I don't expect to grieve overmuch. Like to kill you myself, I see you again. The Operative: You won't... [small, grim smile] The Operative: There is nothing left to see. </strong></p1>
