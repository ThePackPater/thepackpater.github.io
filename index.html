                 <p1><strong> Jayne Cobb: We're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode! Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms. Jayne Cobb: I just get excitable as to choice- like to have my options open. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job. Jayne Cobb: Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No grenades. [Jayne groans] Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No grenades! Zo�: We crashin' again? Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Go talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped? Zo�: Good to go sir. Just loading her up. Are those grenades? Jayne Cobb: Cap'n doesn't want them. Zo�: We're robbing the place, we're not occupying it. Inara Serra: I'm fine! I'm... giddy. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Ya know, for a woman schooled in telling men what they want to hear, you ain't much of a liar. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? We got the primary buffer panel coming right... Kaylee Frye: Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You told me those entry couplings would hold for another week! Kaylee Frye: That was six months ago, Cap'n. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [the Operative has politely asked Mal to return River] You have to open with payment. The Operative: That is a trap. I offer money, you'll play the man of honor and take umbrage; I ask you to do what is right and you'll play the brigand. I have no stomach for games. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: But it ain't all buttons and charts, little albatross. You know what the first rule of flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say. River Tam: I do. But I like to hear you say it. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Love. You can learn all the math in the 'Verse, but you take a boat in the air that you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as a turn of the worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurtin' before she keels. Makes her a home. River Tam: Storm's getting worse. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: We'll pass through it soon enough. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: We're going to need paint. We're going to need red paint. The Operative: [to Mal] You cannot make me angry. Inara Serra: Please, spend an hour with him! Dr. Simon Tam: [referring to River] One simple job. She'll be fine. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: She is fine! Except for still being crazy! She's the picture of health. The Operative: Define "disappeared". Shepherd Book: It's not your way, Mal. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I have a way? Is that better than a plan?</strong></p1>
